# Data Science and ML Projects
This repo includes the projects and case studies I have attempted for the purpose of learning through implementation. Main tool used for the analysis is **Jupyter Notebook**. Although all the individual notebooks are inclusive of respective elaboration as appropriate. Anyone learning to grasp the basic concepts of Data Science and ML are highly encouraged to use my notebooks for their understanding on the workings of the techniques or the workflow. 
The pipeline all of my projects have in common:
  - Exploring the dataset, developing a feel of the dataset
  - Explanatory Date Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Modeling
  - Model Optimisation and evaluation
  - Feedback and re-evaluate
